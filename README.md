# openweather-async2
A library building off of
[kilroyjones/openweather-async](https://github.com/kilroyjones/openweather-async) with
some updates to support API changes upstream and more recent dependencies.

Made for use in a personal project.  I have ripped out a lot of old methods from the
upstream, while adding basic support for the `/forecast`
(<https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#data>) API 2.5 endpoint, as I just don't want to
support something I'm not using.
